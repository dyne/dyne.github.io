# Dyne.org

> Dyne.org is a digital community and free software foundry established in 1999. We create tools, practices and narratives that empower artists, creatives and citizens in the digital age, promoting civil rights, decentralization, free and open-source software, security and efficiency.

**Core Values:**
- **Diversity**: We mix methods, disciplines, knowledge, culture and languages in our Bastard Culture approach
- **Open Source**: We build software to communicate, interact and inspire - code is our literature
- **Ecology**: We recycle old technology rather than create needs for new, respecting the environment and optimizing resources

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Cryptography and privacy-preserving technologies
- Media production and creative tools
- Decentralized systems and sovereign infrastructure
- GNU/Linux distributions and system tools

**Organization:**
- Non-profit foundation established 2005, registered in Amsterdam (KvK.NL reg.num. 34237525)
- Community-driven development with 25+ years of free software heritage
