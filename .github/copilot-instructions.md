*   `src/layouts/`: Contains layout components that define the structure of pages.
*   `src/content/`: Contains content collections, managed by Astro's content collections API.
*   `public/`: Contains static assets that are copied to the build output as-is.
*   `astro.config.mjs`: The Astro configuration file.
*   `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts.

## Development

To run the website locally, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev

To build the website for production, use:

```bash

## How to Contribute

When adding new features or fixing bugs, please follow the existing patterns:

*   For new pages, create a file in `src/pages/`.
*   For new reusable UI elements, create a component in `src/components/`.
*   Ensure that new code is properly linted and formatted by running `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format`.
