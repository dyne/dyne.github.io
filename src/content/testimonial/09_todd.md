My company Computer Dudes uses Tomb for long term encrypted storage on external hard drives and usb drives which have to be connected to a computer for access. It is a very secure way to store new and old files. They make much more than just Tomb including custom Linux Operating Systems like Devuan and Dynebolic. All these can be downloaded for free from the website at dyne dot org.
