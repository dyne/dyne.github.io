Jaro Mail is an integrated suite of interoperable tools to manage **e-mail communication** in a **private and efficient** way, without relying too much on on-line services, in fact encouraging users to store their email locally.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, Jaro Mail reuses existing **free and open source** tools working since more than 10 years (and likely to exist for longer) and is mainly targeted to **Apple/OSX** and **GNU/Linux** desktop usage.

## Console email is the way! but what is this really made of?

To use Jaro Mail on your desktop client, you will require some programs. These programs are ready into the Apple/OSX package, but you will have to install them by yourself if you use GNU/Linux, preferably using your favourite package manager.

## Documentation

> “The aptly named JaroMail is a step in the right direction – precisely how I’ve used email the last 10 yrs” – Julian Oliver

It is **recommended that you read the user manual**: this is not exactly a typical consumer grade software and you won’t get far unless you know what you are doing. Even for experienced Mutt users there are things to learn in the manual, on how Jaro Mail redesigns the e-mail workflow for instance with whitelisting and remote sieve folders.\
[User Manual](http://files.dyne.org/jaromail/jaromail-manual.pdf)

*Seriously, if you are wondering what this software does and you are not satisfied by this silly homepage: the PDF manual is the place to look. It explains it all in detail, click the green button above and read the manual \*grin\**

## Download

### Encrypted storage


![nyan mail cat](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/nyanmailcat_horizbar-600.png)

If you are concerned about your privacy, or in need to keep your communication confidential, then we recommend you to encrypt your emails using the [GNU Pretty Good Privacy](http://www.gnupg.org) tools and ask your peers to do the same.

To also encrypt your email archive when downloaded on local storage one can use [Tomb, the crypto undertaker](http://tomb.dyne.org) a small program to create encrypted folders promoting techniques that are well secure like key/storage separation, steganography etc.

<Software id="tomb"/>

Tomb integrates very well with Jaro Mail: one can make the `~/Mail` and `~/.gnupg` directories reside inside a tomb which will mount them in place inside the `$HOME` via its **bind-hooks**.
