We focus on developing software that benefits society, rather than generate profits and profits. It's about developing technology that people can understand and control, rather than having people being controlled by machines. Building communities is valuable in the long term, with other types of benefits that are not monetary, because there are other ways to prosper and earn. Software not just about money, it's about participation, ideas, people and a sense of community.
