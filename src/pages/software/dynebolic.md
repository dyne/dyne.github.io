✊🏿 **There can be no peace without justice.** This software is a tool for resistance, to share knowledge and information in a Babylonian world that seeks to control the way we communicate as much as possible. This software is for all those who cannot afford new expensive equipment to express their consciousness and words of goodwill. This software is not just for consuming information: it has a whole series of tools for producing it. It is a complete multimedia studio, thanks to it you do not need to buy anything to express yourself. Freedom, knowledge sharing and empowerment are the pillars of our development. That is where this software comes from.

🔥 **Dynebolic is a Live and 100% Free Operating System for multimedia production,** it runs from a USB stick and it requires no installation, giving you a chance to try GNU/Linux applications without any ads,  spyware or attempts to make you pay to express your creativity. We include free software to create your own media and not just consume it with a gratis player and expensive producer products, because we believe in free speech and freedom of creation. Jah Bless You.

🫰🏾 **In this Babylonian world, money is a vital necessity in order to make one's voice heard.** Capitalist and ideological governments rule the world by using a monopoly on mass television and corporate social media to propagate their principles, and suppress all criticism. With Dynebolic we break free from exploitative operating systems: always demanding expensive hardware, giving us gratis players while requiring us to spend money to make and share our own creations.

🖖🏾 **Dynebolic is a self-contained production and publishing tool.** There is no need to spend anything, it contains everything you need for production. It commits to the Free System Distribution Guidelines of the GNU project and includes exclusively free software: we reject nonfree applications, nonfree programming platforms, nonfree drivers and firmware, nonfree games, and any other nonfree software, as well as nonfree manuals or documentation. 


## Version IV

Ten years have passed and today we are back with a brand new Dynebolic 4.0 based on Devuan 5 "Daedalus", live-boot and the Linux kernel 6.8 series.

We introduce a new user experience organized as different journeys into creativity, that we call workflows. Our desktop adopts KDE 5 Plasma and its "Activities" to provide pre-sets for five specific workflows:

- Streaming
- Audio
- Video
- Graphics
- Publishing

Each activity is easily reached from the desktop panel or via keyboard shortcuts and offers everything needed for each workflow, while excluding the noise of other workflows, without compromising on access. If you are working for example in the Graphic workflow, nothing is stopping you from starting an app that pertains to, say, the Video workflow. Activities are easily customizable by the user in the system settings.

## 🫱🏻‍🫲🏿 Join us

Those who remember how dynebolic was already 20 years ago recall well that we are not just working on a wonderful distribution to introduce people to the Free Software Movement and its original values, but we also facilitate a community of creatives that help each other to make this distribution better. You are very welcome to join us in the online channels and give use feedback: this release is BETA, because we need your help.

- [IRC](https://irc.dyne.org/?channels=dynebolic)
- [Matrix](https://socials.dyne.org/matrix-dynebolic)

## 🏁 The path to the final release 
While you may already be able to produce work in most workflows with this beta release, expect bugs. 

#### 🔊 Audio production
This part still needs a lot of love; proper audio routing still needs to be configured. For this, we are currently experimenting with PipeWire, but you are more than welcome to join us in the quest for the optimal interoperable configuration. Dynebolic emphasizes reuse: it is of utmost importance that the final state be compatible with as many devices as possible, including older sound-devices.

#### 🎨 Wallpaper
Currently, each activity has a placeholder wallpaper-art that works. But ultimately, we'd love to have an artwork for each workflow. Is this your call? Join us in the channels to propose your vision of the most beautiful and functional artwork.

#### 🧩 Modules
Also for this new release of Dynebolic there is an easy way to brew your own modules and distribute them freely from your website, contact us if you are interested to know and and help us writing up this part of the documentation.

## What is Dynebolic?

### 100% Free, As In Speech

Dynebolic is a [GNU+Linux distribution](http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) recommended by the **[Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org)**: no proprietary software is inside, no closed source firmware, no hockus pockus. Everything is transparent and can be peer reviewed. All of this without ever compromising with the expression creatives rely on.

![libre-35444\_140x140](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/libre-35444_140x140.png)

You are free to study, modify, redistribute and even sell this Operating System, as long you grant the same freedom to your peers.

### Friendly To The Environment

> Dynebolic is designed to run on copmuters with extremly low resources (Dynebolic III was benchmarked at Pentium2 processors with 256MB RAM). It can even run in ram: not even a harddisk is required.

![](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/recycle-15172_1280-e1422457346278.jpg)

Unleash the full potential of computers, including **second hand machines**. Let’s put an end to consumerism and use what already exists to its full potential.

### Digital Resistance

The Dynebolic Operating System is about resilience and digital resistance. In a reality where governments and corporation are excercising control by monitoring the way people communicate, hackers, creatives and citizens of the digital era have a common interest in keeping their computing sovereign. To accomplish this, sharing knowledge is paramount.

Liberate yourself from mental slavery. Embrace sovereign communication. Free your mind, open the source!

### Freedom Needs Privacy

Dynebolic Operating System does not include any cloud-service and does not establish background communications without the consent of the user. 

![foster\_privacy](/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/foster_privacy.png)

Dynebolic also includes support for strong encryption of private data, thanks to Dyne.org's [Tomb](/software/tomb).

### Freedom Of Expression

More than the means of media playback, Dynebolic includes free software for the production of professional grade multimedia.

![dancing-tux](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dancing-tux.gif)

For everything you can see and play, Dynebolic includes the software to create it. This Operating System lets you express yourself, without the need to rent a license or install additional components. Dynebolic was built to make it possible for people to be the independent producers of their own story. Not just content creators for corporate platforms or consumers of information.

## Appreciated Worldwide

Since its birth in 2000, Dynebolic has been redistributed by several magazines and adopted by universities, community initiatives, medialabs and public institutions around the World.
