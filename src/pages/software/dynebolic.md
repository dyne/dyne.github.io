## What is Dyne:bolic?

### 100% Free, As In Speech

Dyne:bolic is a [GNU+Linux distribution](http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) recommended by the **[Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org)**: no proprietary software is inside, no closed source firmware, no hockus pockus. Everything is transparent and can be peer reviewed. All of this without ever compromising with the expression creatives rely on.

![libre-35444\_140x140](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/libre-35444_140x140.png)

You are free to study, modify, redistribute and even sell this Operating System, as long you grant the same freedom to your peers.

### Friendly To The Environment

> Dyne:bolic is designed to run on copmuters with extremly low ressources (Dyne:bolic III was benchmarked at Pentium2 processors with 256MB RAM). It can even run in ram: not even a harddisk is required.

Unleash the full potential of computers, including **second hand machines**. Let’s put an end to consumerism and use what already exists to its full potential.

### Digital Resistance

The Dyne:bolic Operating System is about resilience and digital resistance. In a reality where governments and corporation are excercising control by monitoring the way people communicate, hackers, creatives and citizens of the digital era have a common interest in keeping their computing sovereign. To accomplish this, sharing knowledge is paramount.

Liberate yourself from mental slavery. Embrace sovereign communication. Free your mind, open the source!

For everything you can see and play, Dyne:bolic includes the software to create it. This Operating System lets you express yourself, without the need to rent a license or install additional components. Dyne:bolic was built to make it possible for people to be the independent producers of their own story. Not just content creators for corporate platforms or consumers of information.
