# DarkFi :: A free and open-source anonymous P2P ecosystem and cryptocurrency

![DarkFi logo](/images/darkfi.png)

# About DarkFi

DarkFi is a new Layer 1 blockchain, designed with anonymity at the
forefront. It offers flexible private primitives that can be wielded
to create any kind of application. DarkFi aims to make anonymous
engineering highly accessible to developers.

DarkFi uses advances in zero-knowledge cryptography and includes a
contracting language and developer toolkits to create uncensorable
code.

In the open air of a fully dark, anonymous system, cryptocurrency has
the potential to birth new technological concepts centered around
sovereignty. This can be a creative, regenerative space - the dawn of
a Dark Renaissance.
