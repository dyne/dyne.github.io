## 🧩 Custom components

Any component below can be used inline inside markdown extended (.mdx files)
 
Standalone button:
```
<Button text="Click Me" href="#" /> 
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── page.md
│       └── page.mdx (<- markdown + html)
│       └── page/index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

The comma separated file `public/dyne-timeline.csv` holds the contents of the timeline of events shown on homepage: updating it will update the website.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
